## 🎓 Understanding Harmonic Mean
Harmonic mean is a type of average. It is useful in situations where you want to find average rates or ratios. This application makes it easy by allowing you to calculate it without complex formulas. Just enter your values, and the app will do the rest!

### Why Use Harmonic Mean?
- **Rate Averages**: It's particularly useful for average rates like speed or efficiency.
- **Resistant to Large Values**: The harmonic mean tends to dampen the impact of extreme values, making it effective in many statistical analyses.
